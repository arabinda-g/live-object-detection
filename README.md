# Live Object Detection


## Introduction
This project is a live object detection system using a pre-trained model. The model used is the SSD MobileNet model. The model is trained on the COCO dataset. The model is used to detect objects in a live video feed. The model is implemented using the OpenCV library. The model is able to detect 80 different objects. The model is able to detect objects in real-time.
